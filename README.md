# Exercise 1

# Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

# For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.

# For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.

# For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

# Exercise 2

# Given an input of two arrays of any length, your program should return an array containing the result of interleaving the smallest array with the largest array maintaining the order of both arrays

#

# For example:

#

# a = ['a', 'b', 'c']

# b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# interleave(a, b)

#

# => [1, 2, 'a', 3, 4, 'b', 5, 6, 'c', 7]
